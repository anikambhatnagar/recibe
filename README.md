# Welcome to Recibe!

This webapp allows users who don't know what to cook for dinner and are needing inspiration for their meals to find ideas.  To use Recibe, search by ingredient or allow Recibe to choose a recipe for you!

This project was created using Create React through VS Code.  Google's Firebase was used to host this application and the API we used was TheMealDB.
